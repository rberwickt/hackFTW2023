## Rainforest Preservation (climate change)
Create a software or hardware solution that can improve tropical environments (Health, Safety, Culture, etc.) and/or limit deforestation

#### Possible Issues to Address:
* Climate Change (big one)
* Deforestation
  * Palm Oil
* Cattle/Agriculture
* Fires
* Mining


## Ideas (probably nodeJS):
* Awareness Website with map to see deforestation
  * Try to make interactive with donation links and alternative lumber near the user?
* Product Company + Ingredient Searcher (is this product affecting the amazon/tropical environments)
* Life Forest 500 Score Website (promising)
  * https://forest500.org/rankings/companies
  * The user creates a list of companies they use daily, and if they have a forest 500 score you can average their personal support

### Forest 500 Website Checklist
- [ ] Create Functioning Website
- [ ] Allow user to create list of companies they use often (problems arise with companies being owned by groups ie. PepsiCo)
- [ ] Display ratings of companies listed by user, maybe average user score
- [ ] View company profiles to see if they are making an effort
- [ ] Suggest similar companies in the sector if the score is very low for a user inputted company
- [ ] General activism and things to avoid page
